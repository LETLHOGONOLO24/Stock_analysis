REVERSE_ENGINEERING STOCK_ANALYSIS PROGRAM

1 - Include namespace and standard library headers:
	iostream for input/output operations
	fstream for file handling
	
	sstream for string streaming
	vector for dynamic arrays
	
	string for string manipulation
	limits for numeric limits
	
	iomanip for output formatting
	stdexcept for exception handling
	algorithm for algorithms like remove
	
2 - Define a structure called StockRecord that will group three pieces of data called
	date as a string, close as a double, volume as long long
3 - Inside the int main(), declare a variable called filename that will be the CSV file
	- Ask the user to input the name of the csv file
	
	- Use the input function to put the name of the csv file typed by the user as filename

4 - declare an ifstream object named file that will open your filename
5 - Check if the file object is not open using the is_open function and if its not open,
	print an error message that says couldn't open the file, prints the file name and returns 1
	to indicate program failure
	
6 - Declare a string variable called line and check whether you can't GET the first line of
	the object file and if you can't, print an error message saying the file is empty or
	corrupt and returns 1
	
7 - Declare a vector that will store the StockRecord structure and call it records
8 - loop through each and every line in the object file using the getline function

	- Check whether the string line is empty and if its empty, continue reading other lines
	- Declare a stringstream object called ss that will read the string line
	
	- Declare strings:
		-Date that will be the date in the while loop
		-closeStr that will be the closing of the price
		
		-volumeStr that will be the volume of the ticker in the CSV
		-open that will be the opening of the price of the ticker in the CSV
		
		-high that will be the highest in price the ticker has reached
		-low that will be the lowest in price the ticker has reached
		
	- Since you declared the strings, declare if statements for each string to:
		-Check if you can't get the line using the stringstream object to check for the
		strings using comma as a delimiter, and if it can't do that, continue
		
	- Declare a try for exception handling for data conversion. Inside the try:
		-Use the erase function on the closeStr and inside the erase function, use the
		remove function, and inside the remove function, use the begin and end functions
		on closeStr so that the erase function can read closeStr from beginning to end to
		remove the dollar sign in string format, then close the remove function with the
		end function on closeStr
		
		-Use the erase function on the volumeStr and inside the erase function, use the
		remove function, and inside the remove function, use the begin and end functions
		on volumeStr so that the erase function can read volumeStr from beginning to end to
		remove comma in string format, then close the remove function with the
		end function on volumeStr
		
		-Declare a double variable called closeVal and set it to a stod function, inside of
		it being closeStr. The stod function will convert closeStr to a double closeVal
		-Declare a long long variable called volumeVal and set it to a stoll function, inside
		of it being volumeStr. The soll function will convert volumeStr to a long long varable
		called volumeVal
		
		-Declare StockRecord object called rec
		-Set the date of the StockRecord struct to string date
		
		-Set the close of the StockRecord struct to closeVal
		-Set the volume of the StockRecord struct to volumeVal
		
		-Use the push_back function on the records vector to push the rec object data inside
		it
	-Use the catch function for exception handling inside of it being or to catch a constant
	invalid_argument object named ia and it must be a REFERENCE of it. If the catch is true:
		
		-Use the cerr output function to print "Warning: Skipping line with non-numeric fields: "
		On a LINE, then end the line and continue
	
	-Use another catch function with a referenced const out_of_range object called oor. If the
	catch is true:
		-Use the cerr output function to print "Warning: Numeric value out of range in line: "
		on a LINE, then end the line and continue
		
9 - Outside of the while loop, use the cout function to print "First 3 parsed rows:" and end the
	line
10 - Use the for loop and inside of the for loop should be:

	- i must be 0, i must be less than 3 AND i must be less than the size of the records vector,
	and increment i
	- Use the cout function to print:
	
		-The date inside the records vector at i
		-The close inside the records vector at i (Highlight with a string)
		
		-The volume inside the records vector at i (Highlight with a string)
11 - Use the close function to close the ifstream file object

12 - Declare an output function that will print "Loaded ", the size of the records vector using
	the size function, " rows from ", string filename, and end the line
13 - Use the if statement to check if the records vector is empty or not using the empty function.
	If its empty, print "No data to analyze. Exiting.", end the line and return 0

14 - Declare a double variable called sumClose and set it to 0.0
15 - Declare a dobule variable called maaxClose and set it to a numeric_limits data structure
	that is a double and ::lowest function which is the lowest number in C++
	
16 - Declare a double variable called minClose and set it to a numeric_limits data structure
	 that is a double and ::max function which is the highest number in C++
17 - Declare a long long variable called totalVolume and set it to 0

18 - Declare a double variable called firstClose and set it to the front of the close in the
	records vector using the front function
19 - Declare a double variable called lastClose and set it to the back of the close in the records
	vector using the back function
	
20 - Declare a for loop to loop inside the records vector with r as your constant, auto that is
	referenced iterator. Inside the for loop:
	- Declare a double variable called c and set it to the close of an iteration
	
	- Add sumClose with c for each iteration
	- If c is greater than maxClose, set maxClose to c
	
	- If c is less than minClose, set minClose to c
	- Add totalVolume to the iterate of volume inside records for each iteration
	
21 - Declare a double variable called avgClose and set it to sumClose divided by static_cast<double>
	inside being the size of records
22 - Declare a double variable called percentChange and set it to ((lastClose minus firstClose) divided
	by firstClose) multiplied by 100
	
23 - Declare an output function, set fixed and set setprecision(2)
24 - Declare an output function that prints "----- Stock Summary -----" and end the line

25 - Declare an output function that prints "Records: ", the size of records and end the line
26 - Declare an output function that prints "Average Close: $", double avgClose and end the line

27 - Declare an output function that prints "Highest Close", double maxClose and end the line
28 - Declare an output function that prints "Average Close: $", double avgClose and end the line

29 - Declare an output function that prints "Lowest Close: $", double minClose and end the line
30 - Declare an output function that prints "Total Volume: ", long long totalVolume and end the line

31 - Declare an output function that prints "Percent change (first -> last): ", double percentChange
	and end the line
32 - Declare a vector that stores variables that have the data type double called dailyReturns

33 - Declare a for loop, set i to 1 with a data type of size_t, set i to be less than the size of records,
	and increment i
34 - Inside the for loop:
	- Declare a double variable called prevClose and set it to the close of records and an index minus 1
	
	- Declare a double variable called currClose and set it to the close of records at an index
	- Declalre a double variable called dailyReturn and set it to ((currClose minus prevClose) divided by
	prevClose) multiplied by 100.0
